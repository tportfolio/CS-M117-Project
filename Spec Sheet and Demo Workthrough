LOGISTICS BEHIND EACH STEP
    a. Login generates random number (should be a built in Java function)
        Delay for a bit, then prompt for Username/Year
        Use create_new_user.php (fbID=randValue, name = username, year = year)
        Will return a USERID: use this for Future ID calls (call this UID)
        ***Be sure to store your UID as a global variable****
    b. Same as a
    c. On "Create New Group", go to a new screen (can call it createGroup or something)
    d.  Prompt for "Group Name"
        On submit, use create_new_group.php (UID = UID, groupName = groupName)
        Go to GroupList screen
    d2. To populate GroupList, use get_group_ID.php (UID = UID)
            for each value from the JSON, call get_group_name.php (groupID = groupID)
            for each value returned, create a new group item

    e. onclick, go to a new screen (can be called GroupInformation), pass groupID as global variable 
        To populate this, use get_group_tasks.php
    f. On Add User click, query get_all_users.php
        Populate the list by matching usernames and UIDs (they'll be in the same order)
    g. When the username is clicked, use add_user_to_group.php (UID = the associated UID, groupID = groupID as global variable)
    h. When Create Task is clicked, go to Create Task page (remember to pass groupID as a var)
    i. Prompt: title, description, priority (1-10)
        use create_new_task.php (groupID = stored groupID, completed = False, title = input Title, description = input description, priority = priority)
    j. View groups is jsut a get_group_ID.php call from d2
    k. Task list is populated by get_group_tasks.php, using the groupID
        for each value, populate a task (just the title)
    l. Clicking into the task should show the rest of the values e.g. description, priority, completion, etc
    m. Clicking Assign User should create a list of group users, done by get_group_members.php, then cross referencing that with get_user_info.php
    n. Assign user by calling assign_task_to_user.php
    o. Hit the back button I guess?
    p. View tasks is done by get_user_tasks.php, populate the list with response
    q. Go to Task Information screen, populated with information gotten from the repsonse from p.
    r. You can make it completed by using complete_task.php
